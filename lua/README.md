Lua was my first language and starting out was quite frustating because the language was
pretty easy but the way I was learning it left me scratching my head. I started out reading
from the official documentation which was a bit difficult for me to comprehend but I kept on
reading and practicing. I eventually went on to youtube videos which made things a lot easier
for me to understand.

CODE BLUE's tutorials were a breath of fresh air to me at the time because he broke things
down in a simple and understandable manner and to someone who was new to coding this was
exactly what I needed.
